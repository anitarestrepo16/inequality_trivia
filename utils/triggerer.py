class Triggerer():
    '''
    Attributes:
    - trigger_labels_to_send: dictionary of trigger types (strings) paired with the bit number (1-127) that
     will be sent to Biolab to trigger that flag.
    - trigger_labels_received: dictionary of trigger types (strings) paired with the bit number (1-255,
      odd numbers only) that Biolab will register as belonging to that flag (for stupid reasons of Mindware
      designing the Bionex to communicate with EPrime).
    Methods:
    - set_trigger_labels: Takes a list of strings and pairs them with unique trigger labels 
    (both to send and received). Sets attributes trigger_labels_to_send and trigger_labels_received.
    - send_trigger: takes a trigger type and optional duration parameter and sends a trigger
    (move pins to adequate bit number and brings them back down after a certain duration (default = .002s))
    - create_txt_file: Create the txt file that needs to be read into Biolab in the events tab.
